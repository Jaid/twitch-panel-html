You become obsessed with one Survivor.
Your Obsession's altruistic action speed is increased by {tiers:38%/44%/50%}.
Once the Obsession is killed or sacrificed, every other Survivor gets a penalty of {tiers:19%/22%/25%} to repair, healing and sabotage speed.
If the Killer becomes obsessed with another survivor, the penalties are removed and that survivor's altruistric action speed is increased.
The Killer can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time.
