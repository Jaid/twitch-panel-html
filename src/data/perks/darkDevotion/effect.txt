You become obsessed with one Survivor. Hitting the Obsession with your basic attack causes the Obsession to emit a 32 meter Terror Radius for {tiers:20/25/30} seconds. During that time, your Terror Radius is reduced to 0 meters.
The Obsession hears the Terror Radius they emit for the duration.
The Killer can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time.
